""":mod:`numpy.ma..mrecords`

Defines the equivalent of :class:`numpy.recarrays` for masked arrays,
where fields can be accessed as attributes.
Note that :class:`numpy.ma.MaskedArray` already supports structured datatypes
and the masking of individual fields.

    ----------
    arraylist : sequence
        A list of (masked) arrays. Each element of the sequence is first converted
