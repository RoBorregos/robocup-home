Pytest test running.

This module implements the ``test()`` function for NumPy modules. The usual
boiler plate for doing that is to put the following in the module
``__init__.py`` file::

    from numpy._pytesttester import PytestTester
    test = PytestTester(__name__).test
    del PytestTester


Warnings filtering and other runtime settings should be dealt with in the
``pytest.ini`` file in the numpy repo root. The behavior of the test depends on
whether or not that file is found as follows:

* ``pytest.ini`` is present (develop mode)
    All warnings except those explicily filtered out are raised as error.
* ``pytest.ini`` is absent (release mode)
    DeprecationWarnings and PendingDeprecationWarnings are ignored, other
    warnings are passed through.

In practice, tests run from the numpy repo are run in develop mode. That
includes the standard ``python runtests.py`` invocation.

This module is imported by every numpy subpackage, so lies at the top level to
simplify circular import issues. For the same reason, it contains no numpy
imports at module scope, instead importing numpy within function calls.

class PytestTester(object):
    """
    Pytest test runner.

    This class is made available in ``numpy.testing``, and a test function
    is typically added to a package's __init__.py like so::

      from numpy.testing import PytestTester
      test = PytestTester(__name__).test
      del PytestTester

    Calling this test function finds and runs all tests associated with the
    module and all its sub-modules.

    Attributes
    ----------
    module_name : str
        Full path to the package to test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module_name : module name
        The name of the module to test.

        """
        Run tests for module using pytest.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : {'fast', 'full'}, optional
            Identifies the tests to run. When set to 'fast', tests decorated
            with `pytest.mark.slow` are skipped, when 'full', the slow marker
            is ignored.
        verbose : int, optional
            Verbosity value for test outputs, in the range 1-3. Default is 1.
        extra_argv : list, optional
            List with any extra arguments to pass to pytests.
        doctests : bool, optional
            .. note:: Not supported
        coverage : bool, optional
            If True, report coverage of NumPy code. Default is False.
            Requires installation of (pip) pytest-cov.
        durations : int, optional
            If < 0, do nothing, If 0, report time of all tests, if > 0,
            report the time of the slowest `timer` tests. Default is -1.
        tests : test or list of tests
            Tests to be executed with pytest '--pyargs'

        Returns
        -------
        result : bool
            Return True on success, false otherwise.

        Notes
        -----
        Each NumPy module exposes `test` in its namespace to run all tests for
        it. For example, to run all tests for numpy.lib:

        >>> np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP

        Examples
        --------
        >>> result = np.lib.test() #doctest: +SKIP
        ...
        1023 passed, 2 skipped, 6 deselected, 1 xfailed in 10.39 seconds
        >>> result
        True
