Conversion from ctypes to dtype.

In an ideal world, we could acheive this through the PEP3118 buffer protocol,
something like::

    def dtype_from_ctypes_type(t):
        # needed to ensure that the shape of `t` is within memoryview.format
        class DummyStruct(ctypes.Structure):
            _fields_ = [('a', t)]

        # empty to avoid memory allocation
        ctype_0 = (DummyStruct * 0)()
        mv = memoryview(ctype_0)

        # convert the struct, and slice back out the field
        return _dtype_from_pep3118(mv.format)['a']

Unfortunately, this fails because:

* ctypes cannot handle length-0 arrays with PEP3118 (bpo-32782)
* PEP3118 cannot represent unions, but both numpy and ctypes can
* ctypes cannot handle big-endian structs with PEP3118 (bpo-32780)
