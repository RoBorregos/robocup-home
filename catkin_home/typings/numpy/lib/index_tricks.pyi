    Construct an open mesh from multiple sequences.

    This function takes N 1-D sequences and returns N outputs with N
    dimensions each, such that the shape is 1 in all but one dimension
    and the dimension with the non-unit shape value cycles through all
    N dimensions.

    Using `ix_` one can quickly construct index arrays that will index
    the cross product. ``a[np.ix_([1,3],[2,5])]`` returns the array
    ``[[a[1,2] a[1,5]], [a[3,2] a[3,5]]]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : 1-D sequences
        Each sequence should be of integer or boolean type.
        Boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the
        corresponding dimension (equivalent to passing in
        ``np.nonzero(boolean_sequence)``).

    Returns
    -------
    out : tuple of ndarrays
        N arrays with N dimensions each, with N the number of input
        sequences. Together these arrays form an open mesh.

class RClass(AxisConcatenator):
    """
    Translates slice objects to concatenation along the first axis.

    This is a simple way to build up arrays quickly. There are two use cases.

    1. If the index expression contains comma separated arrays, then stack
       them along their first axis.
    2. If the index expression contains slice notation or scalars then create
       a 1-D array with a range indicated by the slice notation.

    If slice notation is used, the syntax ``start:stop:step`` is equivalent
    to ``np.arange(start, stop, step)`` inside of the brackets. However, if
    ``step`` is an imaginary number (i.e. 100j) then its integer portion is
    interpreted as a number-of-points desired and the start and stop are
    inclusive. In other words ``start:stop:stepj`` is interpreted as
    ``np.linspace(start, stop, step, endpoint=1)`` inside of the brackets.
    After expansion of slice notation, all comma separated sequences are
    concatenated together.

    Optional character strings placed as the first element of the index
    expression can be used to change the output. The strings 'r' or 'c' result
    in matrix output. If the result is 1-D and 'r' is specified a 1 x N (row)
    matrix is produced. If the result is 1-D and 'c' is specified, then a N x 1
    (column) matrix is produced. If the result is 2-D then both provide the
    same matrix result.

    A string integer specifies which axis to stack multiple comma separated
    arrays along. A string of two comma-separated integers allows indication
    of the minimum number of dimensions to force each entry into as the
    second integer (the axis to concatenate along is still the first integer).

    A string with three comma-separated integers allows specification of the
    axis to concatenate along, the minimum number of dimensions to force the
    entries to, and which axis should contain the start of the arrays which
    are less than the specified number of dimensions. In other words the third
    integer allows you to specify where the 1's should be placed in the shape
    of the arrays that have their shapes upgraded. By default, they are placed
    in the front of the shape tuple. The third argument allows you to specify
    where the start of the array should be instead. Thus, a third argument of
    '0' would place the 1's at the end of the array shape. Negative integers
    specify where in the new shape tuple the last dimension of upgraded arrays
    should be placed, so the default is '-1'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Not a function, so takes no parameters


    Returns
    -------
    A concatenated ndarray or matrix.

    Now, we create indices to manipulate a 3-D array:

    >>> d3 = np.diag_indices(2, 3)
    >>> d3
    (array([0, 1]), array([0, 1]), array([0, 1]))

    And use it to set the diagonal of an array of zeros to 1:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 2, 2), dtype=int)
    >>> a[d3] = 1
    >>> a
    array([[[1, 0],
            [0, 0]],
           [[0, 0],
            [0, 1]]])

    Return the indices to access the main diagonal of an n-dimensional array.
