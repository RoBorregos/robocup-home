    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
         Axis or axes along which to flip over. The default,

def average(a, axis=..., weights=..., returned=...):
    """
    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a
        conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        axis=None, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.
    returned : bool, optional
        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)
        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.
        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of
        elements over which the average is taken.


    Returns
    -------
    retval, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double
        Return the average along the specified axis. When `returned` is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. `sum_of_weights` is of the
        same type as `retval`. The result dtype follows a genereal pattern.
        If `weights` is None, the result dtype will be that of `a` , or ``float64``
        if `a` is integral. Otherwise, if `weights` is not None and `a` is non-
        integral, the result type will be the type of lowest precision capable of
        representing values of both `a` and `weights`. If `a` happens to be
        integral, the previous rules still applies but the result dtype will
        at least be ``float64``.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When the length of 1D `weights` is not the same as the shape of `a`
        along axis.

    Evaluate a piecewise-defined function.

    Given a set of conditions and corresponding functions, evaluate each
    function on the input data wherever its condition is true.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray or scalar
        The input domain.
    condlist : list of bool arrays or bool scalars
        Each boolean array corresponds to a function in `funclist`.  Wherever
        `condlist[i]` is True, `funclist[i](x)` is used as the output value.

        Each boolean array in `condlist` selects a piece of `x`,
        and should therefore be of the same shape as `x`.

        The length of `condlist` must correspond to that of `funclist`.
        If one extra function is given, i.e. if
        ``len(funclist) == len(condlist) + 1``, then that extra function
        is the default value, used wherever all conditions are false.
    funclist : list of callables, f(x,*args,**kw), or scalars
        Each function is evaluated over `x` wherever its corresponding
        condition is True.  It should take a 1d array as input and give an 1d
        array or a scalar value as output.  If, instead of a callable,
        a scalar is provided then a constant function (``lambda x: scalar``) is
        assumed.
    args : tuple, optional
        Any further arguments given to `piecewise` are passed to the functions
        upon execution, i.e., if called ``piecewise(..., ..., 1, 'a')``, then
        each function is called as ``f(x, 1, 'a')``.
    kw : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments used in calling `piecewise` are passed to the
        functions upon execution, i.e., if called
        ``piecewise(..., ..., alpha=1)``, then each function is called as
        ``f(x, alpha=1)``.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The output is the same shape and type as x and is found by
        calling the functions in `funclist` on the appropriate portions of `x`,
        as defined by the boolean arrays in `condlist`.  Portions not covered
        by any condition have a default value of 0.

    Notes
    -----
    This is similar to choose or select, except that functions are

    Return the gradient of an N-dimensional array.

    The gradient is computed using second order accurate central differences
    in the interior points and either first or second order accurate one-sides

    The returned gradient hence has the same shape as the input array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : array_like
        An N-dimensional array containing samples of a scalar function.
    varargs : list of scalar or array, optional
        Spacing between f values. Default unitary spacing for all dimensions.
        Spacing can be specified using:

        1. single scalar to specify a sample distance for all dimensions.
        2. N scalars to specify a constant sample distance for each dimension.
           i.e. `dx`, `dy`, `dz`, ...
        3. N arrays to specify the coordinates of the values along each
           dimension of F. The length of the array must match the size of
           the corresponding dimension
        4. Any combination of N scalars/arrays with the meaning of 2. and 3.

        If `axis` is given, the number of varargs must equal the number of axes.
        Default: 1.

    edge_order : {1, 2}, optional
        Gradient is calculated using N-th order accurate differences
        at the boundaries. Default: 1.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.1

    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Gradient is calculated only along the given axis or axes
        The default (axis = None) is to calculate the gradient for all the axes
        of the input array. axis may be negative, in which case it counts from
        the last to the first axis.

        .. versionadded:: 1.11.0

    Returns
    -------
    gradient : ndarray or list of ndarray
        A set of ndarrays (or a single ndarray if there is only one dimension)
        corresponding to the derivatives of f with respect to each dimension.
        Each derivative has the same shape as f.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> f = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16], dtype=float)
    >>> np.gradient(f)
    array([ 1. ,  1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5,  5. ])
    >>> np.gradient(f, 2)
    array([ 0.5 ,  0.75,  1.25,  1.75,  2.25,  2.5 ])

    Spacing can be also specified with an array that represents the coordinates
    of the values F along the dimensions.
    For instance a uniform spacing:

    >>> x = np.arange(f.size)
    >>> np.gradient(f, x)
    array([ 1. ,  1.5,  2.5,  3.5,  4.5,  5. ])

    Or a non uniform one:

    >>> x = np.array([0., 1., 1.5, 3.5, 4., 6.], dtype=float)
    >>> np.gradient(f, x)
    array([ 1. ,  3. ,  3.5,  6.7,  6.9,  2.5])

    For two dimensional arrays, the return will be two arrays ordered by
    axis. In this example the first array stands for the gradient in
    rows and the second one in columns direction:

    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float))
    [array([[ 2.,  2., -1.],
            [ 2.,  2., -1.]]), array([[ 1. ,  2.5,  4. ],
            [ 1. ,  1. ,  1. ]])]

    In this example the spacing is also specified:
    uniform for axis=0 and non uniform for axis=1

    >>> dx = 2.
    >>> y = [1., 1.5, 3.5]
    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float), dx, y)
    [array([[ 1. ,  1. , -0.5],
            [ 1. ,  1. , -0.5]]), array([[ 2. ,  2. ,  2. ],
            [ 2. ,  1.7,  0.5]])]

    It is possible to specify how boundaries are treated using `edge_order`

    >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> f = x**2
    >>> np.gradient(f, edge_order=1)
    array([ 1.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  7.])
    >>> np.gradient(f, edge_order=2)
    array([-0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.])

    The `axis` keyword can be used to specify a subset of axes of which the
    gradient is calculated

    >>> np.gradient(np.array([[1, 2, 6], [3, 4, 5]], dtype=float), axis=0)
    array([[ 2.,  2., -1.],
           [ 2.,  2., -1.]])

    Notes
    -----
    Assuming that :math:`f\\in C^{3}` (i.e., :math:`f` has at least 3 continuous
    derivatives) and let :math:`h_{*}` be a non-homogeneous stepsize, we
    minimize the "consistency error" :math:`\\eta_{i}` between the true gradient
    and its estimate from a linear combination of the neighboring grid-points:

    .. math::

        \\eta_{i} = f_{i}^{\\left(1\\right)} -
                    \\left[ \\alpha f\\left(x_{i}\\right) +
                            \\beta f\\left(x_{i} + h_{d}\\right) +
                            \\gamma f\\left(x_{i}-h_{s}\\right)
                    \\right]

    By substituting :math:`f(x_{i} + h_{d})` and :math:`f(x_{i} - h_{s})`
    with their Taylor series expansion, this translates into solving
    the following the linear system:

    .. math::

        \\left\\{
            \\begin{array}{r}
                \\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma=0 \\\\
                \\beta h_{d}-\\gamma h_{s}=1 \\\\
                \\beta h_{d}^{2}+\\gamma h_{s}^{2}=0
            \\end{array}
        \\right.

    The resulting approximation of :math:`f_{i}^{(1)}` is the following:

    .. math::

        \\hat f_{i}^{(1)} =
            \\frac{
                h_{s}^{2}f\\left(x_{i} + h_{d}\\right)
                + \\left(h_{d}^{2} - h_{s}^{2}\\right)f\\left(x_{i}\\right)
                - h_{d}^{2}f\\left(x_{i}-h_{s}\\right)}
                { h_{s}h_{d}\\left(h_{d} + h_{s}\\right)}
            + \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{h_{d}h_{s}^{2}
                                + h_{s}h_{d}^{2}}{h_{d}
                                + h_{s}}\\right)

    It is worth noting that if :math:`h_{s}=h_{d}`
    (i.e., data are evenly spaced)
    we find the standard second order approximation:

    .. math::

        \\hat f_{i}^{(1)}=
            \\frac{f\\left(x_{i+1}\\right) - f\\left(x_{i-1}\\right)}{2h}
            + \\mathcal{O}\\left(h^{2}\\right)

    With a similar procedure the forward/backward approximations used for
    boundaries can be derived.

@array_function_dispatch(_diff_dispatcher)
def diff(a, n=..., axis=..., prepend=..., append=...):
    """
    Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

    The first difference is given by ``out[n] = a[n+1] - a[n]`` along
    the given axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff`
    recursively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array
    n : int, optional
        The number of times values are differenced. If zero, the input
        is returned as-is.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the difference is taken, default is the
        last axis.
    prepend, append : array_like, optional
        Values to prepend or append to "a" along axis prior to
        performing the difference.  Scalar values are expanded to
        arrays with length 1 in the direction of axis and the shape
        of the input array in along all other axes.  Otherwise the
        dimension and shape must match "a" except along axis.

    Returns
    -------
    diff : ndarray
        The n-th differences. The shape of the output is the same as `a`
        except along `axis` where the dimension is smaller by `n`. The
        type of the output is the same as the type of the difference
        between any two elements of `a`. This is the same as the type of
        `a` in most cases. A notable exception is `datetime64`, which
        results in a `timedelta64` output array.

    Notes
    -----
    Type is preserved for boolean arrays, so the result will contain
    `False` when consecutive elements are the same and `True` when they
    differ.

    For unsigned integer arrays, the results will also be unsigned. This
    should not be surprising, as the result is consistent with
    calculating the difference directly:

    >>> u8_arr = np.array([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.diff(u8_arr)
    array([255], dtype=uint8)
    >>> u8_arr[1,...] - u8_arr[0,...]
    array(255, np.uint8)

    If this is not desirable, then the array should be cast to a larger
    integer type first:

    >>> i16_arr = u8_arr.astype(np.int16)
    >>> np.diff(i16_arr)
    array([-1], dtype=int16)

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])
    >>> np.diff(x, n=2)
    array([  1,   1, -10])

    >>> x = np.array([[1, 3, 6, 10], [0, 5, 6, 8]])

    array([[2, 3, 4],
           [5, 1, 2]])
    >>> np.diff(x, axis=0)
    array([[-1,  2,  0, -2]])

    >>> x = np.arange('1066-10-13', '1066-10-16', dtype=np.datetime64)

    """
    One-dimensional linear interpolation.

    Returns the one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolant to a function
    with given discrete data points (`xp`, `fp`), evaluated at `x`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The x-coordinates at which to evaluate the interpolated values.

    xp : 1-D sequence of floats
        The x-coordinates of the data points, must be increasing if argument
        `period` is not specified. Otherwise, `xp` is internally sorted after
        normalizing the periodic boundaries with ``xp = xp % period``.

    fp : 1-D sequence of float or complex
        The y-coordinates of the data points, same length as `xp`.

    left : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x < xp[0]`, default is `fp[0]`.

    right : optional float or complex corresponding to fp
        Value to return for `x > xp[-1]`, default is `fp[-1]`.

    period : None or float, optional
        A period for the x-coordinates. This parameter allows the proper

        If `xp` and `fp` have different length
        If `xp` or `fp` are not 1-D sequences
        If `period == 0`

    Notes
    -----
    Does not check that the x-coordinate sequence `xp` is increasing.
    If `xp` is not increasing, the results are nonsense.
    A simple check for increasing is::

        np.all(np.diff(xp) > 0)

    vectorize(pyfunc, otypes=None, doc=None, excluded=None, cache=False,
              signature=None)

    Generalized function class.

    Define a vectorized function which takes a nested sequence of objects or
    numpy arrays as inputs and returns a single numpy array or a tuple of numpy
    arrays. The vectorized function evaluates `pyfunc` over successive tuples
    of the input arrays like the python map function, except it uses the
    broadcasting rules of numpy.

    The data type of the output of `vectorized` is determined by calling
    the function with the first element of the input.  This can be avoided
    by specifying the `otypes` argument.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pyfunc : callable
        A python function or method.
    otypes : str or list of dtypes, optional
        The output data type. It must be specified as either a string of
        typecode characters or a list of data type specifiers. There should
        be one data type specifier for each output.
    doc : str, optional
        The docstring for the function. If `None`, the docstring will be the
        ``pyfunc.__doc__``.
    excluded : set, optional
        Set of strings or integers representing the positional or keyword
        arguments for which the function will not be vectorized.  These will be
        passed directly to `pyfunc` unmodified.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    cache : bool, optional
       If `True`, then cache the first function call that determines the number
       of outputs if `otypes` is not provided.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    signature : string, optional
        Generalized universal function signature, e.g., ``(m,n),(n)->(m)`` for
        vectorized matrix-vector multiplication. If provided, ``pyfunc`` will
        be called with (and expected to return) arrays with shapes given by the
        size of corresponding core dimensions. By default, ``pyfunc`` is
        assumed to take scalars as input and output.

        .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    vectorized : callable
        Vectorized function.

    >>> vfunc = np.vectorize(myfunc)
    >>> vfunc([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
    array([3, 4, 1, 2])

    >>> vfunc = np.vectorize(myfunc, doc='Vectorized `myfunc`')
    >>> vfunc.__doc__

    The output type is determined by evaluating the first element of the input,

    The `excluded` argument can be used to prevent vectorizing over certain
    arguments.  This can be useful for array-like arguments of a fixed length
    such as the coefficients for a polynomial as in `polyval`:

    >>> def mypolyval(p, x):
    ...     _p = list(p)
    ...     res = _p.pop(0)
    ...     while _p:
    ...         res = res*x + _p.pop(0)
    ...     return res
    >>> vpolyval = np.vectorize(mypolyval, excluded=['p'])
    >>> vpolyval(p=[1, 2, 3], x=[0, 1])
    array([3, 6])

    Positional arguments may also be excluded by specifying their position:

    >>> vpolyval.excluded.add(0)
    >>> vpolyval([1, 2, 3], x=[0, 1])
    array([3, 6])

    The `signature` argument allows for vectorizing functions that act on
    non-scalar arrays of fixed length. For example, you can use it for a
    vectorized calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient and its p-value:

    >>> import scipy.stats
    >>> pearsonr = np.vectorize(scipy.stats.pearsonr,
    ...                         signature='(n),(n)->(),()')
    >>> pearsonr([[0, 1, 2, 3]], [[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]])
    (array([ 1., -1.]), array([ 0.,  0.]))

    Or for a vectorized convolution:

    >>> convolve = np.vectorize(np.convolve, signature='(n),(m)->(k)')
    >>> convolve(np.eye(4), [1, 2, 1])
    array([[ 1.,  2.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  1.,  2.,  1.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  1.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  1.,  2.,  1.]])

    Notes
    -----
    The `vectorize` function is provided primarily for convenience, not for
    performance. The implementation is essentially a for loop.

    If `otypes` is not specified, then a call to the function with the
    first argument will be used to determine the number of outputs.  The
    results of this call will be cached if `cache` is `True` to prevent
    calling the function twice.  However, to implement the cache, the
    original function must be wrapped which will slow down subsequent
    calls, so only do this if your function is expensive.

    The new keyword argument interface and `excluded` argument support
    further degrades performance.

def cov(m, y=..., rowvar=..., bias=..., ddof=..., fweights=..., aweights=...):
    """
    Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance
    of :math:`x_i`.

    See the notes for an outline of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : array_like
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : array_like, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same form
        as that of `m`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : bool, optional
        Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is the
        number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
        then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be overridden by using
        the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
    ddof : int, optional
        If not ``None`` the default value implied by `bias` is overridden.
        Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased estimate, even if both
        `fweights` and `aweights` are specified, and ``ddof=0`` will return
        the simple average. See the notes for the details. The default value
        is ``None``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.5
    fweights : array_like, int, optional
        1-D array of integer frequency weights; the number of times each
        observation vector should be repeated.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10
    aweights : array_like, optional
        1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights are
        typically large for observations considered "important" and smaller for
        observations considered less "important". If ``ddof=0`` the array of
        weights can be used to assign probabilities to observation vectors.

        .. versionadded:: 1.10

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The covariance matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    corrcoef : Normalized covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation
    array `m` and let ``f = fweights`` and ``a = aweights`` for brevity. The
    steps to compute the weighted covariance are as follows::

        >>> w = f * a
        >>> v1 = np.sum(w)
        >>> v2 = np.sum(w * a)
        >>> m -= np.sum(m * w, axis=1, keepdims=True) / v1
        >>> cov = np.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)

    Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
    ``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (np.sum(f) - ddof)``
    as it should.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
    correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:

    >>> x = np.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 1, 0]])

    Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
    matrix shows this clearly:

    >>> np.cov(x)
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])

    Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
    :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.

    Further, note how `x` and `y` are combined:

    >>> x = [-2.1, -1,  4.3]
    >>> y = [3,  1.1,  0.12]
    >>> X = np.stack((x, y), axis=0)
    >>> print(np.cov(X))
    [[ 11.71        -4.286     ]
     [ -4.286        2.14413333]]
    >>> print(np.cov(x, y))
    [[ 11.71        -4.286     ]
     [ -4.286        2.14413333]]

    Notes
    -----
    Due to floating point rounding the resulting array may not be Hermitian,
    the diagonal elements may not be 1, and the elements may not satisfy the
    inequality abs(a) <= 1. The real and imaginary parts are clipped to the
    interval [-1,  1] in an attempt to improve on that situation but is not
    much help in the complex case.

    This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`.  This is
    for backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function.  These
    arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and can be
    safely ignored in this and previous versions of numpy.

    The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three

    than a Kaiser window.

    The Hamming window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = 0.54 - 0.46cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi{n}}{M-1}\\right)
               \\qquad 0 \\leq n \\leq M-1

    The Hamming was named for R. W. Hamming, an associate of J. W. Tukey
    and is described in Blackman and Tukey. It was recommended for
    smoothing the truncated autocovariance function in the time domain.
    Most references to the Hamming window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

    Notes
    -----
    The Kaiser window is defined as

    .. math::  w(n) = I_0\\left( \\beta \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4n^2}{(M-1)^2}}
               \\right)/I_0(\\beta)

    with

    .. math:: \\quad -\\frac{M-1}{2} \\leq n \\leq \\frac{M-1}{2},

    where :math:`I_0` is the modified zeroth-order Bessel function.

    The Kaiser was named for Jim Kaiser, who discovered a simple
    approximation to the DPSS window based on Bessel functions.  The Kaiser
    window is a very good approximation to the Digital Prolate Spheroidal
    Sequence, or Slepian window, which is the transform which maximizes the
    energy in the main lobe of the window relative to total energy.

    The Kaiser can approximate many other windows by varying the beta
    parameter.

    ====  =======================
    beta  Window shape
    ====  =======================
    0     Rectangular
    5     Similar to a Hamming
    6     Similar to a Hanning
    8.6   Similar to a Blackman
    ====  =======================

    A beta value of 14 is probably a good starting point. Note that as beta
    gets large, the window narrows, and so the number of samples needs to be
    large enough to sample the increasingly narrow spike, otherwise NaNs will
    get returned.

    Most references to the Kaiser window come from the signal processing
    literature, where it is used as one of many windowing functions for
    smoothing values.  It is also known as an apodization (which means
    "removing the foot", i.e. smoothing discontinuities at the beginning
    and end of the sampled signal) or tapering function.

        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `arr`.

    Returns
    -------
    median : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers

        ``np.float64``.  Otherwise, the data-type of the output is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    e., ``V_sorted[(N-1)/2]``, when ``N`` is odd, and the average of the
    two middle values of ``V_sorted`` when ``N`` is even.

    Compute the q-th percentile of the data along the specified axis.

    Returns the q-th percentile(s) of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentile or sequence of percentiles to compute, which must be between
        0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
            A tuple of axes is supported
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.

    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``
          is the fractional part of the index surrounded by ``i``
          and ``j``.
        * 'lower': ``i``.
        * 'higher': ``j``.
        * 'nearest': ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.
        * 'midpoint': ``(i + j) / 2``.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean
    median : equivalent to ``percentile(..., 50)``
    nanpercentile
    quantile : equivalent to percentile, except with q in the range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the q-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a
    array([[10,  7,  4],
           [ 3,  2,  1]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50)
    3.5
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=0)
    array([[ 6.5,  4.5,  2.5]])
    >>> np.percentile(a, 50, axis=1)

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports both indexing conventions through the indexing
    keyword argument.  Giving the string 'ij' returns a meshgrid with
    matrix indexing, while 'xy' returns a meshgrid with Cartesian indexing.
    In the 2-D case with inputs of length M and N, the outputs are of shape
    (N, M) for 'xy' indexing and (M, N) for 'ij' indexing.  In the 3-D case
    with inputs of length M, N and P, outputs are of shape (N, M, P) for
    'xy' indexing and (M, N, P) for 'ij' indexing.  The difference is
    illustrated by the following code snippet::

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=False, indexing='ij')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):

            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[j,i], yv[j,i]

    In the 1-D and 0-D case, the indexing and sparse keywords have no effect.

def append(arr, values, axis=...):
    """
    Append values to the end of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
        Values are appended to a copy of this array.
    values : array_like
        These values are appended to a copy of `arr`.  It must be of the
        correct shape (the same shape as `arr`, excluding `axis`).  If
        `axis` is not specified, `values` can be any shape and will be
        flattened before use.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which `values` are appended.  If `axis` is not
        given, both `arr` and `values` are flattened before use.

    Returns
    -------
    append : ndarray
        A copy of `arr` with `values` appended to `axis`.  Note that
        `append` does not occur in-place: a new array is allocated and
        filled.  If `axis` is None, `out` is a flattened array.

    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    When `axis` is specified, `values` must have the correct shape.

@array_function_dispatch(_digitize_dispatcher)
def digitize(x, bins, right=...):
    """
    Return the indices of the bins to which each value in input array belongs.

    =========  =============  ============================
    `right`    order of bins  returned index `i` satisfies
    =========  =============  ============================
    ``False``  increasing     ``bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i]``
    ``True``   increasing     ``bins[i-1] < x <= bins[i]``
    ``False``  decreasing     ``bins[i-1] > x >= bins[i]``
    ``True``   decreasing     ``bins[i-1] >= x > bins[i]``
    =========  =============  ============================

    If values in `x` are beyond the bounds of `bins`, 0 or ``len(bins)`` is
    returned as appropriate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Input array to be binned. Prior to NumPy 1.10.0, this array had to
        be 1-dimensional, but can now have any shape.
    bins : array_like
        Array of bins. It has to be 1-dimensional and monotonic.
    right : bool, optional
        Indicating whether the intervals include the right or the left bin
        edge. Default behavior is (right==False) indicating that the interval
        does not include the right edge. The left bin end is open in this
        case, i.e., bins[i-1] <= x < bins[i] is the default behavior for
        monotonically increasing bins.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : ndarray of ints
        Output array of indices, of same shape as `x`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `bins` is not monotonic.
    TypeError
        If the type of the input is complex.

    --------
    bincount, histogram, unique, searchsorted

    Notes
    -----
    If values in `x` are such that they fall outside the bin range,
    attempting to index `bins` with the indices that `digitize` returns
    will result in an IndexError.

    .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

    `np.digitize` is  implemented in terms of `np.searchsorted`. This means
    that a binary search is used to bin the values, which scales much better
    for larger number of bins than the previous linear search. It also removes
    the requirement for the input array to be 1-dimensional.

    For monotonically _increasing_ `bins`, the following are equivalent::

        np.digitize(x, bins, right=True)
        np.searchsorted(bins, x, side='left')

    Note that as the order of the arguments are reversed, the side must be too.
    The `searchsorted` call is marginally faster, as it does not do any
    monotonicity checks. Perhaps more importantly, it supports all dtypes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([0.2, 6.4, 3.0, 1.6])
    >>> bins = np.array([0.0, 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 10.0])
    >>> inds = np.digitize(x, bins)
    >>> inds
    array([1, 4, 3, 2])
    >>> for n in range(x.size):
    ...   print(bins[inds[n]-1], "<=", x[n], "<", bins[inds[n]])
    ...
    0.0 <= 0.2 < 1.0
    4.0 <= 6.4 < 10.0
    2.5 <= 3.0 < 4.0
    1.0 <= 1.6 < 2.5
